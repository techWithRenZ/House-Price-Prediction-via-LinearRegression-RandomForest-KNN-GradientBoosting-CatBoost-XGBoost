# Regression-Analysis-of-Californian-Housing-Prices-using-Python

## 1. Introduction
An accurate prediction of house prices is important for buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. The objective of this analysis is to predict median house price in California using various regression models and compare their performance.

<div style="text-align: justify">

The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the ![1990 California census data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) downloaded from Kaggle. The data is not clean so some preprocessing steps are required. The column names are as follows:

- Independent Variable
    - longitude
    - latitude
    - housing_median_age
    - total_rooms
    - total_bedrooms
    - population
    - households
    - median_income
    - ocean_proximity

- Dependent Variable
    - median_house_value

The following models were used for this analysis:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- K-Neighbors Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
